# Hateful-Meme-Identification-System

The popularity of Internet memes grew as a result of current improvements in social
media platforms and content-sharing websites, and today's Internet environment includes
websites devoted just to meme sharing. Memes started off as largely comical, but the concept
evolved through time, and now they span a wide range of topics, including political and social
commentary. Because of the widespread use of memes and their ability to transmit condensed
themes, they have become a popular tool for disseminating hate speech directed at specific
individuals or groups.

Some of the most popular memes, in example, incorporate both visuals and text, making them
difficult for automated systems to comprehend. Because hate speech is intrinsically multimodal,
any autonomous hate speech detection system would need to take both text and visual
information into account in order to accurately describe and forecast the presence of hateful
speech. On the other hand, both of these sorts of information must be processed together,
because the text or visual content may not reflect hateful content on their own, but when
combined, their message changes.
